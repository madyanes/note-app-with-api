# React Note App

An application for managing notes using ReactJS.

I built this app to get a [certificate of expertise from Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/certificates/4EXGN03VQZRL). \
You can try out the live demo [here](https://note-app-with-api.vercel.app/).

## Features

You can perform CRUD processes like any other application, but you need to create an account first before you can use it.

**You can register using random data**, because the backend does not require an email validation process.
